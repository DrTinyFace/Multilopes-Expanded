Inspired by the Multilopes mod, Multilopes Expanded adds 5 new variants of boomalope to the game that can be milked for various resources.

5 variants currently exist: the woodalope, the hyperlope, the ambrolope, the jadalope, and the luciferilope. More versions will be added in future updates.

This mod is a complete standalone, but does *not* add the boomalope variants added in Multilopes as of yet. If you'd like to add those creatures, I'd recommend installing the main mod.

This mod is also A Dog Said compatible if you're using A Dog Said Easy Patcher. Load this mod after that one.

Finally, if you'd like to add your own boomalope variants, I've included .ase files with the base textures I use for the mod. Simply copy and paste one of the existing defs, and make changes as needed.
